# Rust TcpSever. 

A simple and lightweight crate for launching and using a server. 

# Reasons to choose Rust-TcpSever:
* Not Used Third Party [Libraries](https://github.com/Amakesasha/Rust-TcpSever/blob/main/Cargo.toml)!
* [Ease of Use](https://github.com/Amakesasha/Rust-TcpSever/blob/main/examples/default_start.rs)!
* Small Library Size!
* Have [Static Query Processing Thread System](https://github.com/Amakesasha/Rust-TcpSever/blob/main/src/thread_pool.rs)!
* Have [Open Source](https://github.com/Amakesasha/Rust-TcpSever) and [Simple Documentation](https://docs.rs/rust_tcp_sever/latest/rust_tcp_sever/)!
* Have a [Secure License](https://github.com/Amakesasha/Rust-TcpSever/?tab=License-1-ov-file)!
* The Server can [Send any Files](https://github.com/Amakesasha/Rust-TcpSever/blob/main/examples/default_start.rs), and the Site Will Understand them!

## Find Bug or Malfunction?

If you find bug or malfunction, please, [Write to Issues GitHub](https://github.com/Amakesasha/Rust-TcpSever/issues) or Email: amakesasha@gmail.com.

## You came up with an improvement to the project?

Please write any suggestions for adding or changing the functionality of the library to the [Discussion](https://github.com/Amakesasha/Rust-TcpSever/issues) or Email: amakesasha@gmail.com. I have no more ideas what to do(((

## What this "Static Query Processing Thread System"?

This is Modified Thread Pool (From [Rust-Official-Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)), with Static System Control Number Worker (Thread Parse Request).
* When Jobs become More or Qqual to the Number of Worker, Workers are Added until they can handle all of them.
* When there are Fewer Jobs than the Number of Worker, Worker are Removed, Leaving one Spare.

# Future of the library

The library will be updated as new proposals and ideas are received. If I no longer want to develop this project, I will write about it.
